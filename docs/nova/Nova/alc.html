<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The ALC (Arithemtical/Logical Class) in the NOVA is used to perform all
operations requiring the use of arithmetic or logical manipulation of
bit-fields. All instructions in this class involve two accumulators (ACs)
and the Carry bit. Memory is never referenced, save for the instruction
fetch.  All the instructions in this class have a common format:
<PRE>
              Destination            Shift             No
     1        Accumulator           Control           Load
   /   \       /       \           /       \         /    \
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+----+----+----+----+----+
   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+----+----+----+----+----+
       \       /       \           /       \         /    \              /
         Source           Function            Carry             Skip        
       Accumulator                           Control           Control

</PRE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Beyond the base function, specified by the "Function" bit-field above, the
machine may be instructed to perform other operations both before and
after the function is executed.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Bit zero in the Arithmetic/Logic class is always a one. This distunguishes
the class from the I/O and MRI classes.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The two ACs which are to participate in the operation are specified by
the "Source AC" and "Destination AC" with the Destination AC being the
one which (optionally) receives the result of the operation. The Source
and Destination specifiers may refer to the same accumulator.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The "Function" field specifies the basic operation to be performed; there
are eight possible operations, each with their own unique OPcode which
will be discussed below.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Before the operation is executed, the programmer has the option of
initialising the Carry bit to some known value, flipping its
current state, or leaving it alone. This is specified in the "Carry
Control" field by appending "Z", "O", or "C" to the basic OPcode. The
default action is to leave Carry untouched. The possibilities are:
<UL>
<LI>00 - leave Carry in its current state -
<LI>01 - force Carry to a zero before executing <EM>Function</EM> - "Z"
<LI>10 - force Carry to a one before executing <EM>Function</EM> - "O"
<LI>11 - complement (invert) Carry before executing <EM>Function</EM> - "C"
</UL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
After <EM>Function</EM> is performed, the programmer may specify that
the result be shifted either right or left by one bit- position or that
the halves of the word be swapped. These options are specified in the
"Shift Control" field by coding a "L", "R", or "S" in the OPcode. The
two shift operations function as rotates and involve the Carry bit. The
values of the field, and their functions are:
<UL>
<LI>00 - perform no shift or swap - ""
<LI>01 - rotate the result of <EM>Function</EM> left by one bit - "L"
<LI>10 - rotate the result of <EM>Function</EM> right by one bit - "R"
<LI>11 - swap the two halves of the result of <EM>Function</EM> - "S"
</UL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Optionally, it is possible to discard the results of <EM>Function</EM>. This
is useful if it desireable to merely test the outcome of an operation but
the result need not be saved. This is usually used in conjunction with
the <EM>Skip</EM> field, discussed next. Bit 12, the "No-Load" bit, is
set by the programmer by adding a "#" to the OPcode.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Finally, a decision may be made to skip the next instruction in the
sequence, or not, based on the result of <EM>Function</EM>. Skips are
coded by the programmer by appending a ",Skip-OP" following the Destination
AC. The possible skips are:
<UL>
<LI>000 - Never skip - ""
<LI>001 - Always skip - ",SKP"
<LI>010 - Skip if Carry equals zero - ",SZC"
<LI>011 - Skip if Carry is non-zero - ",SNC"
<LI>100 - Skip if the result of <EM>Function</EM> is zero - ",SZR"
<LI>101 - Skip if the result of <EM>Function</EM> is non-zero - ",SNR"
<LI>110 - Skip if either Carry or result are zero (or both) - ",SEZ"
<LI>111 - Skip if <EM>both</EM> carry and result are non-zero - ",SBN"
</UL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
NOTE: In coding for the Nova, it is vitally important that the "No-Load" and
"Never Skip" options are never coded together. This bit configuration is
used by later Novas and the Eclipse line to implement extended instructions.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Each of the ALC instructions will now be discussed in turn by their
respective functions.

<H2>The Instructions</H2>
<P><A NAME="ADD"><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=LEFT></A>
<H3>Add (ADD)</H3>
<DL>
Function code bits: 110<BR>
<DT>Function:
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <STRONG>ADD</STRONG> instruction arithmetically
adds the contents of the Source AC to the Destination AC and places the
result in the Destination AC. If a carry is propagated from bit zero the
Carry bit is inverted. The original contents of the Destination AC and Carry
are lost if the No-Load option is not set. The contents of the Source
AC are not altered.
<P>
<DT>Assembler Syntax:
<DD>ADD[O|Z|C][L|R|S][#]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACS, ACD[, Skip-op]
<P>
<DT>Example:
<DD><PRE>
Start:    AC0=2, AC1=2, C=0, PC=452
Function: ADD 0, 1, SNR
Finish:   AC0=2, AC1=4, C=0, PC=454
</PRE>
</DL>
<P><A NAME="ADC"><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=LEFT></A>
<H3>Add Complement (ADC)</H3>
<DL>
Function code bits: 100<BR>
<DT>Function:
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <STRONG>ADC</STRONG> instruction arithmetically
adds the one's complement of the Source AC to the Destination AC and places
the result in the Destination AC. If the addition causes a carry to
be propagated from bit zero, or if the contents of the Source AC is less
than the contents of the Destination AC, the carry bit is inverted. The
original contents of the Destination AC and Carry are lost if the "No-Load"
option is not set. The contents of the Source AC are not altered.
<P>
<DT>Assembler Syntax:
<DD>ADC[O|Z|C][L|R|S][#]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACS, ACD[, Skip-op]
<P>
<DT>Example:
<DD><PRE>

Finish:   AC0=10, AC1=34, C=1, PC=554
</PRE>
</DL>
<P><A NAME="AND"><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=LEFT></A>
<H3>Logical AND (AND)</H3>
<DL>
Function code bits: 111<BR>
<DT>Function:
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <STRONG>AND</STRONG> instruction performs a
logical AND on the contents of the Source AC and the Destination AC and
places the result in the Destination AC. Carry does not participate in the
operation unless a rotate operation is also specified. The original
contents of the Destination AC are lost unless the "No-Load" bit is
set. The Source AC is unaffected.
<P>
<DT>Assembler Syntax:
<DD>AND[O|Z|C][L|R|S][#]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACS, ACD[, Skip-op]
<P>
<DT>Example:
<DD><PRE>

Function: ANDZ 0, 1
Finish:   AC0=123456 (1010011100101110), AC1=56  (0000000000101110), C=0
</PRE>
</DL>
<P><A NAME="COM"><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=LEFT></A>
<H3>Complement (COM)</H3>
<DL>
Function code bits: 000<BR>
<DT>Function:
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <STRONG>COM</STRONG> operation forms the one's
complement of the Source AC (by inverting it) and places the result into
the Destiantion AC. Carry is unaffected unless a rotation operation is
also specified. The original contents of the Destination AC are lost
unless the "No-Load" bit is set. The Source AC is unaffected.
<P>
<DT>Assembler Syntax:
<DD>COM[O|Z|C][L|R|S][#]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACS, ACD[, Skip-op]
<P>
<DT>Example:
<DD><PRE>
Start:    AC2=10, AC3=20, C=0, PC=1534
Function: COM 2, 3, SKP
Finish:   AC2=10, AC3=177767, C=0, PC=1536
</PRE>
</DL>
<P><A NAME="INC"><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=LEFT></A>
<H3>Increment (INC)</H3>
<DL>
Function code bits: 011<BR>
<DT>Function:
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <STRONG>INC</STRONG> operation increments
the contents of the Source AC by one and places the result into the
Destination AC. If a carry is forced from bit zero by the operation, the
Carry bit is complemented. The original contents of the Destination AC
and Carry are lost unless the "No-Load" bit is set. The Source AC is
not altered.
<P>
<DT>Assembler Syntax:
<DD>INC[O|Z|C][L|R|S][#]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACS, ACD[, Skip-op]
<P>
<DT>Example:
<DD><PRE>
Start:    AC1=10, AC2=20, C=0, PC=376
Function: INC 2, 1, SEZ
Finish:   AC1=21, AC2=20, C=0, PC=1000
</PRE>
</DL>
<P><A NAME="MOV"><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=LEFT></A>
<H3>Move (MOV)</H3>
<DL>
Function code bits: 010<BR>
<DT>Function:
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <STRONG>MOV</STRONG> operation moves the
contents of the Source AC to the Destination AC. The Carry bit does not
participate in the operation unless one of the rotate options is set. The
original contents of the Destination AC are lost unless the "No-Load" bit
is set.
<P>
<DT>Assembler Syntax:
<DD>MOV[O|Z|C][L|R|S][#]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACS, ACD[, Skip-op]
<P>
<DT>Example:
<DD><PRE>
Start:    AC0=150, AC3=20, C=0, PC=3021
Function: MOVS 0, 3, SNR
Finish:   AC0=150, AC3=6400, C=0, PC=3023
</PRE>
</DL>
<P><A NAME="NEG"><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=LEFT></A>
<H3>Negate (NEG)</H3>
<DL>
Function code bits: 001<BR>
<DT>Function:
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <STRONG>NEG</STRONG> operation takes the two's
complement of the contents of the Source AC and places it in the
Destination AC. The original contents of the Destination AC and Carry are
lost unless the "No-Load" bit is set. The Source AC is unaffected.
<P>
<DT>Assembler Syntax:
<DD>NEG[O|Z|C][L|R|S][#]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACS, ACD[, Skip-op]
<P>
<DT>Example:
<DD><PRE>
Start:    AC2=150, AC1=20, C=0, PC=5571
Function: NEG 2, 1, SZR
Finish:   AC2=150, AC1=177630, C=0, PC=5572
</PRE>
</DL>
<P><A NAME="SUB"><HR WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=LEFT></A>
<H3>Subtract (SUB)</H3>
<DL>
Function code bits: 101<BR>
<DT>Function:
<DD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <STRONG>SUB</STRONG> operation arithmetically
subtracts the contents of the Source AC from the contents of the
Destination AC and places the result in the Destination AC. Both operands
are unsigned. If the value in the Source AC is less than, or equal to, the
value in the Destination AC the Carry bit is inverted. The contents of the
Destination AC and Carry are lost unless the "No-Load" bit is set.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation "SUBO AC, AC" is useful for zeroing both an
AC and carry at the same time.
<P>
<DT>Assembler Syntax:
<DD>SUB[O|Z|C][L|R|S][#]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACS, ACD[, Skip-op]
<P>
<DT>Example:
<DD><PRE>
Start:    AC1=725, AC2=1042, C=0, PC=7024
Function: SUB 1, 2, SZC
