<IMG src="http://users.rcn.com/crfriend/museum/images/cbar3.gif" alt="" width=543 height=4><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Certain late- model Novas, and the MicroNOVA class machines have certain
features that distinguish them from the earlier machines. Most notably these
include <A HREF="extend-instr.html#STACK">stack instructions</A>, 
hardware <A HREF="extend-instr.html#MDV">multiply/ divide</A>, 
and, in the Nova 4, <A HREF="extend-instr.html#BYTES">byte
manipulation</A> and <A HREF="extend-instr.html#TRAPS">trap</A>
 capabilities. Late model Novas also have additional 
<A HREF="extend-instr.html#MAGIC">dedicated memory locations</A>
above and beyond earlier systems.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
These extended abilities were implemented using I/O instructions pointing
to device number one - the Multiply/ Divide device in the early Novas. Hence,
all the instructions presented here will use the standard I/O form of:</P>
<BR>

</PRE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
I'm not going to detail all the possible bit positions using the above
diagram, but am going to describe the instructions using the assembler
format. Refer to the <A HREF="io.html">basic I/O instruction</A>
document for bit coding of the individual options.</P>
<A NAME="MDV"><HR><H2>Nova Multiply/Divide</H2></A>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
First, let's have a look at the multiply/ divide instructions. These were
optional on most of the early Nova- class machines but became standard on
the MicroNOVAs.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
<DL>
<DT>MUL - MULtiply (<TT>MUL</TT>)
<DD>The multiply instruction takes two 16 bit operands, stored in AC1 and AC2,
and multiplies them together forming a 32 bit result in AC0 and AC1; AC2
remains untouched. The assembler trnaslates the <TT>MUL</TT> opcode into
a <TT>DOCP 2,MDV</TT> operation. (MDV is the symbolic definition of
device 1 - the multiply/ divide option.)
<P> AC0 is special in this case, as the instruction takes the 16 high- order
bits of the multiplication result and <EM>adds</EM> them into AC0.
<BR>
<DT>DIV - DIVide (<TT>DIV</TT>)
<DD>The divide instruction, obviously enough, performs the reverse of the
multiply operation in that it takes a 32- bit dividend in AC0 and AC1 (high-
order bits in AC0) and divides this quantity by the contents of AC2. The 16-
bit quotient is placed into AC1 and the remainder is placed in AC0. AC2
remains unchanged. The <TT>DIV</TT> mnemonic is translated to a 
<TT>DOCS 2,MDV</TT> by the assembler.
</DL>
<BR>
<A NAME="STACK"><HR><H2>Nova Stack Instructions</H2></A>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Machines commencing with the Nova 3 sport hardware stacks, as do the members
of the MicroNOVA family. These facilities greatly ease the handling of
subroutines and facilitate the writing of re-entrant code. Basic capabilities
like Push and POP are supported as well as some more advanced features. I'll
discuss each in turn.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
All the stack instructions are, in fact, translated into I/O instructions
by the assembler. The device number for all of them is 1 - the same as for
the optional hardware multiply/ divide.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
<DL>
<DT>MTSP - Move To Stack Pointer (<TT>MTSP AC</TT>)
<DD>This instruction moves the specified AC to the Nova's stack pointer,
thereby initialising the stack for operation. This <EM>must</EM> be done
before using the stack! This instruction is translated into a 
<TT>DOA AC,1</TT> by the assembler.
<P>
<DT>MFSP - Move From Stack Pointer (<TT>MFSP AC</TT>)
<DD>This instruction transfers the 15-bit quantity in the stack pointer
and places it into the specified AC. This instruction equates to
a <TT>DOAC AC,1</TT> in the assembler.
<P>
<DT>MTFP - Move To Frame Pointer (<TT>MTFP AC</TT>)
<DD>Initialises the 15- bit Frame Pointer with the contents of the specified
AC. This step <EM>must</EM> be taken before the Frame Pointer is used. The
assembler converts the <TT>MTSP AC</TT> to a <TT>NIO AC,1</TT> I/O instruction.
<P>
<DT>MFFP - Move From Frame Pointer (<TT>MFFP AC</TT>)
<DD>Copies the current 15- bit contents of the Frame Pointer to the
specified AC. The assembler converts the <TT>MFFP AC</TT> to 
a <TT>NIOC AC,1</TT> I/O instruction.
<P>
<DT>PSHA - PuSH an Ac to the stack (<TT>PSHA AC</TT>)
<DD>This increments the stack pointer by one and stores the contents of
the specified AC at the resulting location. The <TT>PSHA AC</TT> notation
is translated to a <TT>DIB AC,1</TT> by the assembler.
<P>
<DT>POPA - POP an Ac from the stack (<TT>POPA AC</TT>)
<DD>This operation pops an AC from the stack by loading the specified AC
with the contents of the memory location specified by the Stack Pointer
then decrementing the Stack Pointer by one. The assember converts the
<TT>POPA AC</TT> notation to a <TT>DIBC AC,1</TT> for execution.
<P>
<DT>SAV - Push a return block onto the stack (<TT>SAV</TT>)
<DD>This instruction pushes a 5 word "return block" onto the stack for
later retrieval by a "RET" instruction. The contents of the return block
are as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Accumulator 0
<LI>Accumulator 1
<LI>Accumulator 2
<LI>Frame Pointer
<LI>Bits 1-15 of AC3 + the carry bit (in bit 0)
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Once the return block is pushed, the machine loads the <EM>updated</EM> contents
of the stack pointer into the Frame pointer and AC3.</P>
</OL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
NOTE: The SAVe instruction is intended to be called immediately following
the execution of a JSR instruction and entry into a subroutine. At this
point in time, AC3 will contain the return address for the subroutine.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The assembler interprets the <TT>SAV</TT> as a <TT>DIC AC,1</TT> I/O
instruction.</P>
<DT>RET - Pop a "return block" from the stack (<TT>RET</TT>)
<DD>This instruction pops a "return block" from the stack which was written
by the "SAV" instruction. Items popped from the stack are:
<OL>
<LI>Bits 1-15 of the Program Counter and the Carry bit
<LI>Accumulator 3
<LI>Accumulator 2
<LI>Accumulator 1
<LI>Accumulator 0
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Once the block is popped, the instruction loads the updated contents of
AC3 into the Frame Pointer. Program execution continues from the PC
value loaded from the stack.</P>
</OL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The assembler interprets the <TT>RET</TT> as a <TT>DICC AC,1</TT> I/O
instruction.</P>
</DL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Memory integrity is protected from runaway stacks by the stack protection
mechanism. This facility causes a trap to location 3 in page zero when the
stack pointer is incremented (or decremented) across a page boundary.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
When a stack fault occurs, the address of the offending instruction is
placed into page zero location 0 and the processor executes an indirect
jump through page zero address 3. This is essentially the same as a
standard Nova interrupt. Note that interrupts must be enabled for a
stack fault to occur.</P>
<A NAME="BYTES"><HR><H2>Byte Manipulation Instructions</H2></A>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Beginning with the Nova 4, machines began to include byte- pointer
instructions thereby lessening the burden on programmers by allowing
them to forget about swapping bytes within words (remember that the
NOVA is word addressed and accessed, not byte addressed). Like the
stack instructions, these resemble I/O instructions addressed to
device one.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The byte pointers used in these instructions are compatible with the
the older style ones, which is to say that the pointer is formed by
taking the word address, shifting it left one bit position thereby
leaving bit 15 to specify which byte is to be manipulated.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
There are two byte manipulation instructions, LDB and STB which will be
described here. The instructions appear in memory in this format:</P>
<PRE>
                        001 or 100
       0 1 1            LDB    STB                  0 0 0 0 0 1
   /           \       /          \        /                            \
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+----+----+----+----+----+
   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+----+----+----+----+----+
               \       /           \       /
                  ACD                 ACS

<BR></PRE>
<DL>
<DT>LDB - LoadD Byte (<TT>LDB acs, acd</TT>)
<DD>The load byte instruction takes the 8-bit byte addressed by the
contents of source AC (acs) and places it into the destination AC (acd). Bits
0-7 of the destination AC are set to zero.<P>
The assembler codes the instruction as <TT>DIA ACD, </TT> and puts the
ACS specifier into the Transfer field. See the above diagram.
</DD><P>
<DT>STB - STore Byte (<TT>STB acs, acd</TT>)
<DD>Functioning in reverse of the LDB instruction, STB takes the right
half of the source AC and places it into the memory location addressed
by the byte pointer in the Destination AC.
<P>
The assembler codes the instruction as <TT>DOB ACD, </TT> and puts the
ACS specifier into the Transfer field. See the above diagram.
</DL>
<BR>
<A NAME="TRAPS"><HR><H2>The Nova 4 Trap Instruction</H2></A>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
In a bow the Eclipse line, and in recognition that the machine classes
were close enough to one another that programs written on the Nova class
could execute natively on the Eclipse machines, the Nova 4 included the
trap instruction designed to catch Eclipse- specific instructions. Creative
programmers could use this facility to emulate lots of the Eclipse
instructions on a Nova 4 if they so desired. The instruction appears
thusly in memory:
<PRE>

     1            ACD                                      1 0 0 0
   /   \       /       \                             /                  \
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+----+----+----+----+----+
   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+----+----+----+----+----+
       \       /       \                             /
          ACS                    Trap Number             

</PRE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The observent reader should note that this is an ALC instruction with
the no-load bit set and the never skip option selected. This is a
combination which normally would never occur in general usage as it
serves no function, other than as a no-op. It gets coded as follows:
<DL>
<DT>TRAP - Trap to location 47 (<TT>TRAP acs, acd, trap_number</TT>)
<DD>Upon encountering this instruction the Nova 4 will, if running in
user mode (mapped machines only), disable the user map, save the address
of the trap instruction to location 46<SUB>(8)</SUB> in page zero, and
jump indirect through location 47<SUB>(8)</SUB>. Unlike and interrupt,
this instruction doesn not change the state of the ION bit.
</DL><P>
<A NAME="MAGIC"><HR><H2>Magic Memory Locations</H2></A>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
In addition to the standard Nova interrupt locations 0 and 1 in page zero,
the extended Novas reserve three other words for trap purposes. These are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>3: Stack Protection Handler Address<P>
<LI>46: Instruction Trap (offending instruction address)
<LI>47: Instruction Trap Handler Address
</UL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The first was discussed in the previous section on 
<A HREF="extend-instr.html#STACK">stack instructions</A>. The
second two reflect the direction that the 16- bit DG line was taking at
the time and presage the coming of the Eclipse extended instructions.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
In the later Nova processors, if an ALC instruction is encountered that
has the "No Load" bit set <STRONG>AND</STRONG> has a "never skip" option
coded into it the machine assumes that the instruction is an Eclipse
construct and traps, first storing the address of the offending instruction
in location 46 then jumping indirectly through location 47.
