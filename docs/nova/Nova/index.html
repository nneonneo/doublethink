<H2>Foreword</H2>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
This document will attempt to describe the Data General NOVA line of 16 bit
computers in sufficient detail to allow a hobbyist to begin to program the
device at a machine- code level.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
This document is not intended to be an in- depth analysis of the machine, nor
is it intended to be a tutorial on programming the device. I've prepared it
primarily as an aid to hobbyists who may have acquired one of these systems
and who wish to use said system as an amusement or part of a working
collection. I've tried to be as accurate as possible, but I'm sure there
are errors and will welcome 
<A HREF="mailto:carl.friend@rcsri.org">E-mail</A> with any corrections.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Enjoy.

<H2>Architecture</H2>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Data General Corporation, of Southborough (now Westborough), Massachusetts
introduced the original Nova in 1969. From those beginnings the Nova line
grew into a family of compatible machines which were formidable competitors
to DEC's pdp11 series.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The Nova can be simply described as a 16-bit 4-accumulator machine
which operates on a load/store basis. This, in plain language, means
that the ALU and data paths are sixteen bits wide (from a programmer's
viewpoint), there are four ACs (Accumulators, aka "registers"), and there are
no fancy addressing modes (as in the pdp11). In addition to the four
16-bit accumulators there is a single-bit register known as "Carry" which
participates in arithmetic and logic instructions.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Words in memory are represented in this document thusly:
<P>
<PRE>
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+----+----+----+----+----+
   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+----+----+----+----+----+
</PRE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The Nova has separate I/O and memory buses and separate classes of
instructions to access each of them. Memory transfers are typically
16-bit words (although the Nova 4 can transfer 8-bit bytes) and I/O
transfers are either 8-bit bytes or full 16-bit words. Both buses are
sixteen bits in width.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The I/O system in the NOVA is defined by a six bit address bus yielding a
total of 64 possible devices. I/O transfers involve the full 16-bit word, but
devices may choose to only use a subset of those bits. A data channel
facility is available for DMA functionality.
<P>
The mainstore in the Nova machines operates on a word basis, 16 bits at a
time. This means that for byte- level accesses, a 16 bit quantity is taken
from memory, and, in necessary, masked/ shifted to provide the desired
eight bit byte. In most of the Nova machines (excepting the Nova 4) there
is no hardware byte- access capability; packing and unpacking words is the
responsibility of the programmer.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The Program Counter (PC) in the Nova is 15 bits in width. This feature
defines the basic 32 kW memory capacity of the machine. Some Novas, beginning
rather early in fact, supported memory management and mapping schemes
which could boost the <EM>physical</EM> memory capacity to as high as
128 kW; logical program space, however, remained at 32 kW.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Data General chose to use the octal (base eight) numbering scheme to
represent values stored in the Nova's memory and in its operation. I'll
stick to that convention here; unless otherwise specified, all numbers
in this document will be expressed in octal.
<P><A NAME="Addressing"><HR></A>
<H2>Memory Addressing in the Nova</H2>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
As mentioned earlier, Novas operate on a load/ store basis. This implies
the existence of (at the very least) instructions to load an AC from
main memory and to store data back to memory. There are also instructions
which access memory for the purposes of program flow control (jumps)
and instructions which modify memory locations (increments). All of
the instructions which access, or modify, memory share the same basic
instruction format.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Novas support three addressing modes, known as "Page Zero", "PC Relative", and
"AC Indexed". Two of the four Accumulators may be used as index
registers, these being AC2 and AC3.
<H3>Producing an Address</H3>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The Nova produces its target (or <EM>Effective</EM>) address (<EM>E</EM>) in
two steps. It first step computes the so-called "intermediate address" which
is the base it uses if indirection is later required. In many cases, the
intermediate address <EM>is</EM> the value required and address calculation
stops there; in others, indirection is required and the intermediate address
forms the first address for that process. Indirection is discussed below.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The basic format for any memory- reference instruction in the Nova is:
<PRE>
                         I          /---------- Displacement ----------\
                       /   \       /                                    \
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+----+----+----+----+----+
   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+----+----+----+----+----+
                           \       /
                              Mode  
</PRE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Bits zero through four control the instruction operation and what ACs
(if any) are to participate in the instruction. The rest of the fields
will be discussed here.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The <EM>Mode</EM> field controls what mode the Nova will use to access
memory. As mentioned above, the Nova supports three different memory
addressing models; the use of the <EM>Displacement</EM> field will
vary according to the mode in use. The modes are as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>00 - Page Zero
<LI>01 - PC-Relative
<LI>10 - AC2 indexed
<LI>11 - AC3 indexed
</UL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Here's how they work:
<P>
<DL><DT>Page Zero:
<DD>In Page Zero addressing, the value of the Displacement field is taken
as an <EM>unsigned</EM> (0 to 255) value and is the value of the intermediate
address. Page Zero addressing may be used from anywhere in the address
space, regardless of Program Counter (PC) contents to access any word in
the lowest 256 memory locations. This mode is selected when both bits
six and seven of the instruction word are "0".
<P><DT>PC-Relative:
<DD>In PC- relative addressing, the Displacement field is used as
a <EM>signed</EM> quantity which is added to the current value of the Program
Counter (PC) to form the intermediate address. This allows access to any
word within the range of PC+127 and PC-128 words. Note that this form
produces inherently relocatable code. In this mode, bit six is a "0"
and bit seven is a "1".
<P><DT>AC Indexed:
<DD>In AC- indexed addressing the Displacement field is taken as
a <EM>signed</EM> value and added to the contents of either AC2 or AC3
to form the intermediate address. In both of these modes, bit six of
the instruction word is a "1" and bit seven selects the desired AC ("0"
for AC2; "1" for AC3).
</DL>
<H3>Indirect Addressing on the Nova</H3>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Once the intermediate address is formed, the machine examines the
value in bit five of the instruction word. If that bit is a "1", then
indirection is called for and further address computation is performed;
if this bit is a "0", then the intermediate address is deemed the
effective address and is used unmodified.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
In indirection, the value which is fetched from the intermediate address
becomes the next address in the chain. This value may, itself, be an
indirect address if bit zero is a "1". If bit zero is "1", then the
word specified by bits one through fifteen is fetched and the indirection
cycle continues. When bit zero of the fetched word is "0", then the
chain is said to be complete and the final address is the value which
last came from memory.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Note that on unmapped Novas it is possible to disable (hang) the machine
by way of an indirection loop. Pressing "stop" on the console will have
no effect on this condition; the machine needs to be reset, and in
doing so all context will be lost. Mapped Novas can have their memory
management hardware cause a trap if an indirection chain goes longer
than sixteen references, but this is not enabled by default. Don't do
indirection loops. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Memory locations 20-27 and 30-37 behave in very special ways when accessed
indirectly. These are <EM>auto-increment</EM> and <EM>auto-decrement</EM> 
locations, respectively. When these locations are addressed in an indirection
chain, their value is increased or decreased by one <EM>before</EM> their
value is fetched for use. They are especially useful for traversing lists
and arrays in linear fashion. When accessed non- indirectly, they behave as
normal memory locations.
<P><A NAME="Interrupts"><HR></A>
<H2>I/O Interrupts on the Nova</H2>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The Nova has a fairly simple interrupt scheme compared to many computers. It's
implemented as a single line system which implies that priority is
associated with a device's physical position on the I/O bus. This is partly
true, but the Nova uses a neat trick with interrupt masks which can be
used to mask out interrupts from certain devices creating a form of
``interrupt priority''. In these paragraphs, I'll attempt to convey to
the reader a sense of how the Nova interrupt system works.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The normal power- up default state of the machine is to have the interrupt
system turned off and interrupts disabled on all the I/O devices. This is
also the state following the issuance of an ``IORST'' instruction. The
interrupt system is ``primed'' by the ``INTEN'' instruction and goes
active after the first instruction following the INTEN.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
When an (interrupt- capable) I/O device requires service, it raises an
interrupt request. The CPU checks this line between each instruction and
if an interrupt request is pending it enters the ``interrupt state''. In
this state the interrupt flag is reset, the current PC (the next
instruction to be executed, in lieu of interrupts) is saved to physical
location zero, and the machine executes an indirect jump through physical
location one.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
It is the programmer's responsibility to place the address of the
interrupt handler into location one, to enable interrupts in the
first place, and to re-enable them following the completion of the
interrupt. It is also the programmer's responsibility to save the
state of the machine (e.g. all ACs and Carry) so the interrupted
program can continue on.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
With interrupts disabled immediately following an interrupt, the handler
need not be concerned with itself being interrupted (unless the programmer
sets it up that way) and can identify the interrupting device. This can
be done either by polling or via the ``INTA'' (Interrupt Acknowledge)
instruction. ``INTA'' will load the device address of the interrupting
device into a selected AC when it is executed (remember to save the
AC before using it!). From there, the driver program can dispatch the
device and handle the request.
<P><A NAME="MagicMem"><HR></A>
<H2>Magic and Reserved Memory Locations on the Nova</H2>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
The basic Nova architecture isn't too big on reserved locations or ``magic''
locations, but there are a few. Locations zero and one in physical memory
are reserved for the interrupt system, and there are a bank of ``special''
locations in the auto-increment and auto-decrement areas. I'll describe those
here. Later machines, of course, have more reserved locations, but those
are beyond the scope of this document.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp
Locations 20 through 37 (octal) in the logical address space (there may
be two location 20s in MAPped machines) behave in a special manner when
accessed indirectly. When hit via an indirection operation, these locations
either increment by one or decrement by one automatically before the
value is taken to be used in the effective address. 20 through 27 are
the auto-incrementing addresses and 30 through 37 are the auto-decrementing
ones. They behave normally when accessed directly. This makes them
useful for traversing lists and areas of core.
