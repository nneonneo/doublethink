<h1>Effective Address Calculation</h1>

All instructions without exception calculate an "effective address".
The effective address gets its name because it is usually used as the
address of an operand in memory.  Depending on the instruction, that
operand might be read, written or both.  For some instructions, called
"immediate" instructions, the effective address is not used to address
memory; it is used directly, as a number, in the operation.  For
example, the ADD instruction uses the effective address as the
address of a location in memory, and uses the contents of that
location in the addition.  The ADDI instruction (Add Immediate) uses
the effective address itself as the number to add.<p>

The effective address computation uses three fields of the instruction
word: the 18-bit address field (Y), the index field (X), and the
indirect bit (I).  The result is an 18-bit effective address.<p>

If the X field and I bit are zero, the effective address is simply the
contents of the address field (Y).<p>

If the index field X is nonzero, then it is the number of an
accumulator to use as an index rgister.  Any accumulator except
accumulator 0 can be so used.  The right half of the contents of the
index register is added to the address field (Y) from the instruction
to get the effective address.<p>

The I bit specifies indirect addressing.  If it is 1, then the result
of the previous steps (Address field, or address field plus index
quantity) is used as the address of an "indirect word".  From the
contents of this indirect word, a new address field Y, index field X
and indirect bit I are obtained.  Then the process starts from the
beginning.  If the I bit in the indirect word is 1, a second indirect
word is eventually fetched.  Indirection can happen any number of
times, and only stops when an indirect word has 0 in its I bit.<p>

The result of the effective address calculation may be thought of as
an instruction word where bits 0:12 are copied from the original
instruction, bits 13:17 are zero, and 18:35 contain the effective
address.<p>

The effective address computation is described by the following
program.  MA means memory address.  PC means program counter.  C(MA)
means contents of the word addressed by MA.
