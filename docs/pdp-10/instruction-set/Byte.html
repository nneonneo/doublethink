<h1>Byte instructions</h1>

In the PDP-10 a "byte" is some number of contiguous bits within one
word.  A byte pointer is a quantity (which occupies a whole word)
which describes the location of a byte.  There are three parts to the
description of a byte: the word (i.e., address) in which the byte
occurs, the position of the byte within the word, and the length of
the byte.<p>

A byte pointer has the following format:

<pre>
 000000 000011 1 1 1111 112222222222333333
 012345 678901 2 3 4567 890123456789012345
 _________________________________________
|      |      | | |    |                  |
| POS  | SIZE |U|I| X  |        Y         |
|______|______|_|_|____|__________________|
</pre>

POS is the byte position: the number of bits from the right end of
the byte to the right end of the word.<p>

SIZE is the byte size in bits.<p>

The U field is ignored by the byte instructions.<p>

The I, X and Y fields are used, just as in an instruction, to compute
an effective address which specifies the location of the word
containing the byte.<p>

Here are the byte instructions.

<ul>

<li>LDB - Load byte.  The contents of the effective address of the LDB
instruction is interpreted as a byte pointer.  The byte described
there is loaded, right adjusted, into the AC.  The rest of the AC is
cleared.

<li>DPB - Deposit byte.  The contents of the effective address of the DPB
instruction is interpreted as a byte pointer.  The byte described
there is deposited from the byte of the same size at the right end of
the AC.  AC and the remainder of the word into which the byte is
deposited are left unchanged.

<li>IBP - Increment byte pointer.  The purpose of this instruction is to
advance a byte pointer to point at the next consecutive byte.  The AC
field must be zero.  The contents of the effective address are
fetched.  The POS field is changed by subtracting the size field from
it.  If the result of the subtraction is greater than or equal to
zero, store the difference in the POS field.  If the difference is
negative, add 1 to the Y field (in the KA10 and PDP-6 if Y contains
777777 then this will carry into the X field; in the KI10 and KL10 the
carry out is suppressed) and set POS field to 44-SIZE (44 is octal).
The effect of this is to modify the byte pointer to address the next
byte (of the same size) that follows the byte addressed by the
original pointer.

<li>ILDB - Increment and Load Byte.  Increment the byte pointer contained
at the effective address.  Then perform a LDB function using
the updated byte pointer.

<li>IDPB - Increment and Deposit Byte.  Increment the byte pointer contained
at the effective address.  Then perform a DPB function using
the updated byte pointer.

</ul>

Text strings are typically stored using seven-bit bytes, five per
word.  ILDB and IDPB can then be used to step through a string.  The
byte pointer should be initialized to 440700,,&lt;address of string&gt;.
Then the first ILDB will increment it to point at the first character
of the string.
