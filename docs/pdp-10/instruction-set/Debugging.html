<h1>Debugging Programs with DDT</h1>

When you try your program for the first time, it won't work.<p>

To find out why, you use the debugging features of DDT.  DDT is
completely documented (*Note DDT: (DDT).) but this is a summary of
what sorts of things you can do with it.<p>

DDT allows you to set a "breakpoint".  Setting a breakpoint at an
instruction means that when the program gets to that instruction it
will stop (return to DDT).  At this time you can examine any location
in the program to see if everything is working right so far.
If it is still working right, you can set another breakpoint, later
on, and continue the program.<p>

When you see that a variable contains a "wrong" value, DDT allows you
to correct the value and continue, from the breakpoint or from
someplace else.  You can also change instructions in the program with
DDT so that you can keep running the program and the problem will not
happen again (but don't forget to make the correction in the source
file as well!)  DDT allows can print instructions and addresses using
the symbols you define in the program, and it understands those
symbols in your input as well.<p>

You can also ask DDT to run your program one instruction at a time.
This is often easier than setting breakpoints.<p>

You don't have to do anything special to be able to use DDT on your
program, because DDT is always available on ITS.  It is the program
which processed your command to run INFO.  You probably don't want to
set any breakpoints in INFO, but if you type C-Z now you could do just
that.<p>
