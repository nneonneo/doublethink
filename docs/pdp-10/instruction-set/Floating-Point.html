<h1>Floating Point Arithmetic</h1>

Single precision floating point numbers are represented in one 36 bit
word as follows:

<pre>
 0 00000000 011111111112222222222333333
 0 12345678 901234567890123456789012345
 ______________________________________
| |       |                            |
|S| EXP   |     Fraction               |
|_|_______|____________________________|
</pre>

If S is zero, the sign is positive. If S is one the sign is negative
and the word is in twos complement format.  The fraction is
interpreted as having a binary point between bits 8 and 9.  The
exponent is an exponent of 2 represented in excess 200 (octal)
notation.  In a normalized floating point number bit 9 is different
from bit 0, except in a negative number bits 0 and 9 may both be one
if bits 10:35 are all zero.  A floating point zero is represented by
a word with 36 bits of zero.  Floating point numbers can represent
numbers with magnitude within the range 0.5*2^|-128 to
(1-2^|-27)*2^|127, and zero.<p>

A number that in which bit 0 is one and bits 9-35 are zero can
produce an incorrect result in any floating point operation.  Any
word with a zero fraction and non-zero exponent can produce extreme
loss of precision if used as an operand in a floating point addition
or subtraction.<p>

In KI10 (and KL10) double precision floating point, a second word is
included which contains in bits 1:35 an additional 35 fraction bits.
The additional fraction bits do not significantly affect the range of
representable numbers, rather they extend the precision.<p>

The KA10 lacks double precision floating point hardware, however
there are several instructions by which software may implement double
precision.  These instructions are DFN, UFA, FADL, FSBL, FMPL, and
FDVL.  Users of the KL10 are strongly advised to avoid using these
intructions.<p>

In the PDP-6 floating pointing is somewhat different.  Consult a wizard.

                          |
                          |
                          |  no rounding  |  result to AC
                                          |L Long mode
                                          |M result to memory
                                          |B result to memory and AC


                   |AD add
DF double floating |SB subtract
                   |MP multiply
                   |DV divide
</pre>

Note: In immediate mode, the memory operand is &lt;E,,0&gt;.  In long mode
(except FDVL) the result appears in AC and AC+1.  In FDVL the AC
operand is in AC and AC+1 and the quotient is stored in AC with the
remainder in AC+1.

<h2>Other floating point instructions:</h2>

FSC (Floating SCale) will add E to the exponent of the number in AC
and normalize the result.  One use of FSC is to convert an integer in
AC to floating point (but FLTR, available in the KI and KL is better)
To use FSC to float an integer, set E to 233 (excess 200 and shift
the binary point 27 bits).  The integer being floated must not have
more than 27 significant bits.  FSC will set AROV and FOV if the
resulting exponent exceeds 127.  FXU (and AROV and FOV) will be set
if the exponent becomes smaller than -128.<p>

DFN (Double Floating Negate) is used only to negate KA10 software
format double precision floating point numbers.  DFN treats AC and E
as a KA10 double floating point number which it negates and stores
back. AC is the high order word.  Usually the low order word is in
AC+1, so the instruction most often appears as DFN AC,AC+1.<p>

UFA (Unnormalized Floating Add) is used in KA10 to assist in software
format double precision arithmetic.  UFA will add C(AC) to C(E) and
place the result in AC+1.  The result of UFA will not be postnormalized
unless in original operands the exponents and signs were the same and
a fraction with magnitude greater than or equal to 1 was produced.  Only
in this case will a one step normalization (right shift) occur.
UFA will overflow in the same circumstances as FAD.  Underflow is not
possible.<p>

FIX will convert a floating point number to an integer.  If the
exponent of the floating point number in C(E) is greater than
(decimal) 35 (which is octal 243) then this instruction will set AROV
and not affect C(AC).  Otherwise, convert C(E) to fixed point by the
following procedure: Move C(E) to AC, copying bit 0 of C(E) to bits
1:8 of AC (sign extend).  Then ASH AC by X-27 bits (where X is the
exonent from bits 1:9 of C(E) less 200 octal).
FIX will truncate towards zero, i.e., 1.9 is fixed to 1
and -1.9 is fixed to -1.<p>

FIXR (Fix and round) will convert a floating point number to an
integer by rounding.  If the exponent of the floating point number in
C(E) is greater than (decimal) 35 (which is octal 243) then this
instruction will set AROV and not affect C(AC).  Otherwise, convert
C(E) to fixed point by the following procedure: Move C(E) to AC,
copying bit 0 of C(E) to bits 1:8 of AC (sign extend).  Then ASH AC
by X-27 bits (where X is the exponent from bits 1:9 of C(E) less 200
octal).  If X-27 is negative (i.e., right shift) then the rounding
process will consider the bits shifted off the right end of AC.  If
AC is positive and the discarded bits are &gt;=1/2 then 1 is added to AC.
If AC is negative and the discarded bits are &gt;1/2 then 1 is added to
AC.  Rounding is always in the positive direction: 1.4 becomes 1, 1.5
becomes 2, -1.5 becomes -1, and -1.6 becomes -2.<p>

FLTR (FLoaT and Round) will convert C(E), an integer, to floating
point and place the result in AC.  The data from C(E) is copied to AC
where its is arithmetic shifted right 8 places (keeping the bits that
fall off the end) and the exponent 243 is inserted in bits 1:8.  The
resulting number is normalized until bit 9 is significant
(normalization may result in some or all of the bits that were right
shifted being brought back into AC).  Finally, if any of the bits
that were right shifted still remain outside the AC the result is
rounded by looking at the bit to the right of the AC.
