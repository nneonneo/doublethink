This node describes some instructions that only KL-10's have.  This
means that the only ITS machine which has them is MC.  You should
probably not use them even if you expect to run on MC, so that your
program can be moved.

<h2>Double word Move instructions (KI10 and KL10)</h2>

There are four double word move instructions.  These are suitable for
manipulating KI10 and KL10 double precision floating point numbers,
and for KL10 double precision integers.

<pre>
DMOVE   C(AC AC+1) &lt;- C(E E+1)
DMOVEM  C(E E+1) &lt;- C(AC AC+1)
DMOVN   C(AC AC+1) &lt;- -C(E E+1)
DMOVNM  C(E E+1) &lt;- -C(AC AC+1)
</pre>

Note that the DMOVN and DMOVNM are NOT to be used for KA10 double
precision floating point numbers!<p>

If a program is written that may be have to be run on a KA10, the use
of all double word instructions should be avoided.

<h2>Double Precision Integer Arithmetic (KL10 only)</h2>

There are four instructions for double precision integer arithmetic.
None of these instructions have any modifier: they all operate on
double (or quadruple) accumulators and double words in memory with
results to double (or quadruple) accumulators.<p>

The format for a double word integer is the same as that produced by
MUL, i.e., a 70 bit integer in twos complement, with bit 0 of the
most significant word is the sign; in operands, bit 0 of the low
order word is ignored.  A quadruple word has 140 bits; bit 0 of the
most significant word is the sign; in operands, bit 0 in all other
words is ignored.  In double (and quadruple) arithmetic results bit 0
of the low order word(s) is stored with the same value as bit 0 of
the high order word.

<pre>
DADD    C(AC AC+1) &lt;- C(AC AC+1) + C(E E+1);
DSUB    C(AC AC+1) &lt;- C(AC AC+1) - C(E E+1);
DMUL    C(AC AC+1 AC+2 AC+3) &lt;- C(AC AC+1) * C(E E+1);
DDIV    C(AC AC+1) &lt;- C(AC AC+1 AC+2 AC+3) / C(E E+1);
                C(AC+2 AC+3) &lt;- remainder;
</pre>
