<h1>Obsolete and not-recommended jump instructions:  JSR, JSP, JSA and JRA</h1>

The JSR and JSP instructions are two non-stack subroutine calls which
are typical of most non-stack machines.  JSP stores the old PC in an
accumulator, and JSR stores it in a word at the beginning of the
subroutine.  JSP is useful once in a while, such as, for a subroutine
whose job is to push or pop several words on the stack.  JSR is useful
only for UUO-handlers.  *Note JSR: UUO Handlers.  PUSHJ and POPJ
should be used for all ordinary subroutines.<p>

JSA and JRA are a peculiar subroutine call and matching return which
were invented for PDP-6 Fortran.  In most programs they are not used
at all.

<pre>
JSR     C(E)&lt;-&lt;flags,,PC&gt;; PC&lt;-E+1;
</pre>

JSR, Jump to SubRoutine, stores the PC in the word addressed by the
effective address and jumps to the word following the word where the
PC is stored.  This is the only PDP-10 instruction that stores the PC
and flags without modifying any ACs; however, it is non-reentrant, so
PUSHJ is favored in most cases.  The usual return from a subroutine
called by a JSR is via JRST (or JRST 2,) indirect through the PC
word.  (See JRST)

<pre>
JSP     C(AC)&lt;-&lt;flags,,PC&gt;; PC&lt;-E;
</pre>

JSP, Jump and Save PC, stores the PC and flags in the selected
accumulator and jumps.

<pre>
JSA     C(E)&lt;-C(AC); C(AC)&lt;-&lt;E,,PC&gt;; PC&lt;-E+1;
</pre>

JSA, Jump and Save AC, stores the AC in word addressed by the
effective address.  Then the left half of the AC is set to the
effective address and the right half of AC is set to the return PC.
Then the PC is set to one greater than the effective address.  The
JRA instruction unwinds this call.  The advantage of this call is
that a routine may have multiple entry points (which is difficult to
do with JSR) and it's easy to find (and later to skip over) arguments
that follow the calling instruction (which is possible to do with
PUSHJ, but not quite so convenient).  Among the disadvantages of this
call is that it is non reentrant, and it doesn't save flags.

<pre>
JRA     C(AC)&lt;-C(CL(AC)); PC&lt;-E;
</pre>

JRA, Jump and Restore AC, is the return from JSA.  If, e.g., a
subrountine is called with JSA AC, then the return is made by:
<pre>
        JRA AC,(AC).
