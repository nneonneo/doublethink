<h1>PC format.</h1>

A subroutine call instruction is one which changes the PC (jumps) but
stores the old value of the PC so that the subroutine can "return"
(jump back) when it is done.  There are several subroutine call
instructions on the PDP-10, but they all store the PC in the same
format:

The right half is the PC proper -- the address of the next instruction
to be executed (the one which follows the subroutine call
instruction).  The other individual bits are the status flags.  They
are stored in case the subroutine wants to restore them when it
returns.<p>

AROV, ARithmetic OVerflow, is set by any of the following:

<ul>
<li>        A single instruction has set one of CRY0 or CRY1 without
                setting them both.
<li>        An ASH or ASHC has left shifted a significant bit out of
                AC bit 1.
<li>        A MULx instruction has multiplied -2^|35 by itself.
<li>        A DMUL instruction has multiplied -2^|70 by itself.
<li>        An IMULx instruction has produced a product less than
                -2^|35 or greater than 2^|35-1.
<li>        A FIX or FIXR has fetched an operand with exponent
                greater than 35.
<li>        FOV (Floating Overflow) has been set.
<li>        DCK (Divide ChecK) has been set.
</ul>

CRY0, short for Carry 0, means that there was a carry out of bit 0 in
an addition.  Note that a carry out of bit 0, with no accompanying
carry out of bit 1 (into bit 0), causes AROV to be set.<p>

The precise conditions which can set CRY0 and not CRY1 are:
<ul>
<li>        An ADDx has added two negative numbers with sum less
                than -2^|35.
<li>        A SUBx has subtracted a positive number from a negative
                number and produced a result less than -2^|35.
<li>        A SOSx or SOJx has decremented -2^|35.
</ul>

CRY1, short for Carry 1, means that there was a carry out of bit 1 in
an addition.  Note that a carry out of bit 1, with no accompanying
carry out of bit 0, causes AROV to be set.<p>

The precise conditions which can set CRY1 and not CRY0 are:
<ul>
<li>        An ADDx has added two positive number with a sum greater
                than 2^|35-1.
<li>        A SUBx has subtracted a negative number from a positive
                number to form a difference greater than 2^|35-1.
<li>        An AOSx or AOJx instruction has incremented 2^|35-1.
<li>        A MOVNx or MOVMx has negated -2^|35.
<li>        A DMOVNx has negated -2^|70
</ul>

In addition, the following non-overflow conditions set both CRY0 and
CRY1:
<ul>
<li>        In ADDx both summands were negative, or their signs differed
                and the postive one was greater than or equal to the
                magnitude of the negative summand.
<li>        In SUBx the sign of both operands was the same and the AC
                operand was greater than or equal to the memory
                operand, or the AC operand was negative and the
                memory operand was postive.
<li>        An AOJx or AOSx has incremented -1.
<li>        A SOJx or SOS has decremented a non zero number other
                than -2^|35.
<li>        A MOVNx has negated zero.
</ul>

FOV, Floating point OVerflow, is set by any of:
<ul>
<li>        In a floating point instruction other than FLTR, DMOVNx,
                or DFN the exponent of the result exceeds 127.
<li>        FXU (Floating eXponent Underflow) has been set.
<li>        DCK (Divide ChecK) has been set by FDVx, FDVRx, or DFDV.
</ul>

FPD, First Part Done, is set when the processor responds to a
priority interrupt, after having completed the first part of a two
part instruction (e.g., ILDB).  This flag is not usually of interest
to the programmer.<p>

USER is set while the processor is in user mode.  In user mode,
various instruction and addressing restrictions are in effect.<p>

IOT, User IN-Out mode, (also called IOT User), is a special mode in
which some of the user mode instruction (but not addressing)
restrictions are removed.  In this mode a user program may perform
the hardware I/O instructions.<p>

[PUBL, Public mode, signifies that the processor is in user public
mode or in exec supervisor mode.  This bit exists only on standard
KL-10 systems;  it is not on ANY ITS system.]<p>

AFI, Address Failure Inhibit, if this flag is set, address break is
inhibited for during the execution of the next instruction [KI10,
KL10 only].<p>

TRAP2 - if bit 10 is not also set, pushdown overflow has occurred.
If traps are enabled, setting this flag immediately causes a trap.
At present no hardware condition sets both TRAP1 and TRAP2
simultaneously.  [KI10 KL10 only]<p>

TRAP1 - if bit 9 is not also set, arithemetic overflow has occurred.
If traps are enabled, setting this flag immediately causes a trap.
At present no hardware condition sets both TRAP1 and TRAP2
simultaneously.  [KI10 KL10 only]<p>

FXU, Floating eXponent Underflow, is set to signify that in a
floating instruction other than DMOVNx, FLTR, or DFN, the exponent of
the result was less than -128 and AROV and FOV have been set.<p>

DCK, Divide ChecK, signifies that one of the following conditions has
set AROV:

<ul>
<li>        In a DIVx the high order word of the dividend was greater than
                or equal to the divisor.
<li>        In an IDIVx the divisor was zero.
<li>        In an FDVx, FDVRx, or DFDV, the divisor was zero, or the
                magnitude of the dividend fraction was greater than
                or equal to twice the magnitude of the divisor fraction.
                In either case, FOV is also set.
</ul>

Bits 13 through 17 of the PC word are always zero to facilitate the
use of indirect addressing to return from a subroutine.<p>

Bits 18 through 35 store an address that is one greater than the
address of the instruction that stores the PC.  Thus, the PC word
points at the instruction immediately following the subroutine call.
