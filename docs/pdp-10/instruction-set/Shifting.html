<h1>Shift instructions</h1>

The following instructions shift or rotate the AC or the double word
formed by AC and AC+1.<p>

Shift instructions are all immediate instructions.  The effective
address is not used as the ddress of a memory operand.  Instead, it is
used as the number of places to shift.  A positive number means a left
shift; a negative number (bit 18 = 1) means a right shift.<p>

Aside from the sign bit of the effective address, only the lowest
eight bits are used.  The other nine bits are ignored.

<ul>
<li>LSH     Logical Shift.  C(AC) is shifted as specified by E.  Zero
        bits are shifted into the AC.

<li>LSHC    Logical Shift Combined.  C(AC AC+1) is shifted as a 72 bit
        quantity.  Zero bits are shifted in.

<li>ASH     Arithmetic Shift.  Bit 0 is not changed.  In a left
        shift zero bits are shifted into the right end of AC.
        In a left shift, if any bit of significance is shifted
        out of bit 1, AROV (overflow) is set.  In a right shift,
        bit 0 is shifted into bit 1.

<li>ASHC    Arithmetic Shift Combined.  AC bit 0 is not changed.  If
        E is non zero, AC bit 0 is copied to AC+1 bit 0.
        C(AC AC+1) is shifted as a 70 bit quantity.  In a left
        shift zero bits are shifted into the right end of AC+1.
        In a left shift, if any bit of significance is shifted
        out of AC bit 1 then AROV is set.  In a right shift AC
        bit 0 is shifted into AC bit 1.

<li>ROT     Rotate.  The 36 bit C(AC) is rotated.  In a left rotate bits
        shifted out of bit 0 are shifted into bit 35.  In a right
        rotate, bit 35 is shifted into bit 0.

<li>ROTC    Rotate Combined.  AC and AC+1 are rotated as a 72 bit
        quantity.  In a left rotate AC bit 0 shifts into AC+1
        bit 35 and AC+1 bit 0 shifts into AC bit 35.  In a right
        rotate, AC+1 bit 35 shifts into AC bit 0, etc.

<li>JFFO    Jump if Find First One.  This is not actually a shift
        instruction, but it is a related sort of thing.  It counts the
        number of leading zeros in the contents of AC, and stores this
        number in AC+1.  (If AC contains zero, the number stored in
        AC+1 is zero, not 36).  The instruction also jumps to its
        effective address if C(AC) # 0 (in other words, if it
        succeeded in finding the first one bit).
</ul>

Example:

<pre>
;Suppose that each bit in accumlator 1 is a flag
;telling us that some sort of processing needs to be done.
;We would like to find out which flags are set
;and, for each one, do the processing.  But we don't want to
;waste a lot of time checking flags which are not set.

LOOP:   JFFO 1,[JRST @TABLE(2)]
        ...                     ;Here all flags are zero.

TABLE:  FOO                     ;FOO handles flag bit 0
        BAR                     ;BAR handles flag bit 1.
        ...                     ;Other addresses for the remaining
flags.

FOO:    ...                     ;Do the work.
        TLZ 1,400000            ;Clear flag bit 0
        JRST LOOP               ;Find the next flag which is set.
