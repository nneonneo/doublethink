<H2><A NAME=general>General</A></H2>

Interrupts are not generally used by OS/8, the most widely used PDP-8
operating system, but they are central to TSS-8 and other PDP-8 based
timesharing systems.  In addition, many stand-alone PDP-8 applications
made extensive use of interrupts.

<P>
A device may request an interrupt when it finishes an input/output
transfer or reaches a similar ready condition.  Typically, each device has
a device specific interrupt-enable flipflop that must be set to allow the
device to post the request; in addition, the CPU contains a global
interrupt-enable flipflop that must be set to allow the CPU to respond to
an interrupt.

<P>
When the CPU accepts an interrupt request, the effect is as if a
<code>JMS</code> instruction was executed to memory location 00000 (word
zero fo field zero).  Thus, the 12 bit return address is stored in location
zero, and execution begins at location one.

<P>
In addition to the transfer of control, the global interrupt enable flipflop
is reset when an interrupt occurs.  If the extended memory option is present,
the <A HREF="mmu.html#rib">interrupt buffer</A> is loaded with a record of
the memory management state prior to the interrupt, and then both IF and DF
are set to zero.

<P>
It is up to the interrupt service routine to save and restore all registers
other than the PC, which was automatically saved in location zero.  In
addition, it is up to the program to determine which device requested an
interrupt and either service or disable that device's interrupt request.

<P>
Under OS/8 (prior to OS/78 and OS/278), the system did not run with interrupts
enabled, but individual applicatons could enable interrupts.  By convention,
it was expected that, on entry to or exit from an application, all devices
would be either ready or would soon become ready (after completing an
operation).  That is, it was expected that all devices would either have
done flags set to indicate operation completion, or they would be busy with
an operation still in progress.

<P>
Thus, under OS/8, the handler for any device typically begins by checking to
see if the previous operation was done before initiating a new operation.
If an application enables interrupts, all devices will typically immediately
request interrupts, and the interrupt handlers must either give the devices
work to do or somehow turn off their done flags because no work is available
for that device.  Prior to exit, such an application would typically disable
interrupts and then issue any device commands needed to get all devices to
raise their done flags.

<H2><A NAME=instrs>Instructions</A></H2>

Formally, the general interrupt management instructions are IOT
instructions involving device 0.  In addition, each device that may
cause interrupts generally has its own interrupt management
instructions; unfortunately, the latter are not standardized.

<P>
Only two interrupt management instructions are universally available
on all PDP-8 models, <code>ION</code> and <code>IOF</code>.  All other
interrupt management instructions are system specific, although the
large majority are uniformly supported by all models after the PDP-8/E.

<P>
All instructions that deal with this option are privileged, and the
detection and trapping of privileged instructions, if supported, is
supported by the Time-Share option that is implemented as a
subsystem of some PDP-8 memory management units.

<H2>Instructions</H2>

<H3><A NAME=skon>6000 - SKON Skip if Interrupt System On</A></H3>

<code>SKON</code> is used to test the state of the interrupt enable
flipflop.  If interrupts are enabled, the next instruction in sequence
is skipped.

<P>
<code>SKON</code> is only available on the PDP-8/E and later models.
On earlier models, this was a no-op.


<H3><A NAME=ion>6001 - ION Interrupts On</A></H3>

<code>ION</code> is used to turn on interrupts.  The effect of this
instruction is delayed one instruction so that, for example, an ION
instruction immediately before a return instruction will not take effect
until the return instruction is executed.


<H3><A NAME=iof>6002 - IOF Interrupts Off</A></H3>

<code>IOF</code> is used to turn off or disable interrupts.  The effect
of this instruction is immediate.  In addition, interrupts are disabled
immediately when an interrupt occurs.

<H3><A NAME=srq>6003 - SRQ Skip on Interrupt Request</A></H3>

<code>SRQ</code> is used to test whether there is a pending interrupt
request.  If a request is pending, the next instruction in sequence is
skipped.  This test is only meaningful when interrupts are disabled; it
may be used, for example, to avoid the expense of an unnecessary return
from interrupt when some device other than the one just serviced is also
requesting service.

<P>
<code>SRQ</code> is only available on the PDP-8/E and later models.
On earlier models, this was probably interpreted as a nondeterministic
microcoded combination of <code>ION</code> and <code>IOF</code>!

<H3><A NAME=gtf>6004 - GTF Get Flags</A></H3>

<code>GTF</code> is similar to <code><A HREF="mmu.html#rib">RIB</A></code>,
but is only available on the PDP-8/E and later models.  This opcode was
used for the Type 189 Analog to Digital Converter option on the original
PDP-8, so it can cause very strange results if executed on the wrong machine!

<P>
<code>GTF</code> loads the accumulator with various information that may
need to be saved and restored during interrupts.  This includes the link
bit, the state of the optional memory management unit, and the greater-than
flag from the optional extended arithmetic unit.  These are packed into
the accumulator in the following format:

<PRE WIDTH="60">
            00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11
            ___________________________________
           |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

           |  |  |  |  |  |  |        |        |
          LINK GT IR II IE  U    IF       DF    
</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> LINK
<DD> -- the link bit.
<DT> GT
<DD> -- the Greater Than bit (see the
	<code><A HREF="intrupt.html#sgt">SGT</A></code> instruction supported
	by the <A HREF="http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/pdp8/man/eae.html">extended arithmetic element</A>.
<DT> IR
<DD> -- the interrupt request status, as tested by
	<code><A HREF="intrupt.html#srq">SRQ</A></code>.  This is set to one if an interrupt
	requesting is pending.
<DT> II
<DD> -- the interrupt inhibit bit associated with the Time-Share option
	of the <A HREF="mmu.html">memory management unit</A>.
<DT> IE
<DD> -- the state of the interrupt enable flipflop, as set by the
	<code><A HREF="intrupt.html#ion">ION</A></code> and reset by the
	<code><A HREF="intrupt.html#iof">IOF</A></code> instructions.
	This is set to one if interrupts are enabled.
<DT> U
<DD> -- the user-mode bit.
<DT> IF
<DD> -- the instruction field.
<DT> DF
<DD> -- the data field.
<BR>  U, IF and DF are the same as the corresponding fields returned
	by the <code><A HREF="mmu.html#rib">RIB</A></code> instruction.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME=rtf>6005 - RTF Restore Flags</A></H3>

<code>RTF</code> restores the state of the flags that are saved by the
<code><A HREF="intrupt.html#gtf">GTF</A></code> instruction, using the same data format.
This instruction is only available on the PDP-8/E and later models; it
can cause strange results when used on earlier machines (possibly acting
as a microcoded combination of <code>GTF</code> and <code>ION</code>).

<P>
<code>RTF</code> ignores the IR (interrupt request) bit that was saved by
<code>GTF</code>, and the IE (interrupt enable) bit is not fully restored
until the instruction after the <code>RTF</code> instruction, so that
a return from interrupt may be executed before the next interrupt request
is serviced.

<H3><A NAME=sgt>6006 - SGT Skip if Greater Than</A></H3>

<code>SGT</code> is only supported if the
<A HREF="http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/pdp8/man/eae.html">extended arithmetic element</A> is present, and then,
only on the PDP-8/E and later machines.  This instruction skips if the
greater than flag is set.

<H3><A NAME=caf>6007 - CAF Clear All Flags</A></H3>

<code>CAF</code> is only supported if the PDP-8/E and later machines.
The effect of the CAF instruction is identical to a master clear issued
from the front panel.  AC and LINK are cleared, interrupts are disabled
globally, and all I/O devices are reset.  Generally, resetting a device
sets the device specific interrupt enable bit and terminates any ongoing
I/O activity.  Resetting a device may initiate long reset and self-test
sequences, and it may leave the device in an odd state, for example when
a reset is issued in the middle of a write operation.

<H2><A NAME=conventions>Programming Conventions</A></H2>

Note that, even on models where the <code>GTF</code> and <code>RTF</code>
instructions are available, interrupt entry and exit can be quite complex,
involving multiple instructions to save and restore the accumulator, link,
multiplier quotient and step counter.  Furthermore, interrupt dispatching,
determining which device requested an interrupt, can be difficult because
the PDP-8 provides nothing analogous to vectored interrupts.
