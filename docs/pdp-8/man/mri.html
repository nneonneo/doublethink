<H2>Instructions</H2>

<H3><A NAME=and>000 - AND</A></H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	AND	M
</PRE>
<P>
The contents of memory location M are logically anded with AC, bit by bit.
There is no effect on the link bit.  All other logical operations
must be accomplished with
<A HREF="mri.html#logic">macros</A>.


<H3><A NAME=tad>001 - TAD</A></H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	TAD	M
</PRE>
<P>
The contents of memory location M are added to AC.
A carry out of the high bit of AC will complement the link bit.
Most other arithmetic operations
must be accomplished with
<A HREF="mri.html#arithmetic">macros</A>.

<H3><A NAME=isz>010 - ISZ</A></H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	ISZ	M
</PRE>
<P>
The contents of memory location M are incremented and placed back
in memory.  If the result stored in memory is zero, the program
counter is incremented; as a result that the next instruction will
be skipped if the result is zero.  AC and LINK are not modified.
<P>
ISZ is frequently used to increment memory addresses; unless the
address could wrap around from 7777 to 0000, ISZ is used as if it
will never skip.  If a wraparound is possible, it must be followed
by a no-op.
<P>
ISZ allows the construction of a number of fast
<A HREF="mri.html#block">macros for block operations</A>.

<H3><A NAME=dca>011 - DCA</A></H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	DCA	M
</PRE>
<P>
The contents of the accumulator are stored in the memory location M;
the accumulator is then cleared.  There is no effect on the link bit.
The corresponding load operation must be accomplished by a
<A HREF="mri.html#load">macro</A>

<H3><A NAME=jms>100 - JMS</A></H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	JMS	P
</PRE>

<P>
The contents of PC (a pointer to the next instruction) is stored in
memory location P as a return address, and then control is
transfered to the location following P.  AC and LINK
remain unchanged.  There is no return instruction; this is done
using an indirect jump through P.

<H3><A NAME=jmp>101 - JMP</A></H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	JMP	P
</PRE>

<P>
Control is transferred to memory location P.  AC and LINK remain
unchanged.

<H2><A NAME=modes>Addressing Modes</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME=pagezero>Z - The Page Select Bit</A></H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	TAD Z	ADDR
	TAD	ADDR
</PRE>
<P>
When the <A HREF="mri.html#format"> Z bit </A> of the instruction is zero,
page zero addressing mode is used.  This allows addressing
of memory locations 0000 through 0177 (octal) of the current memory
from an instruction located anywhere in theat field.  The Z qualifier
may be used to indicate that page zero mode is desired, but most
PDP-8 assemblers will automatically generate page zero mode if the
addressed location is in page zero.

<P>
When the <A HREF="mri.html#format"> Z bit </A> of the instruction is one,
current page addressing mode is used.  This allows addressing of memory
locations in the current page, as determined by the 5 most significant
bits of the program counter (more accurately, the 5 most significant bits
of the address of the location from which the instruction was fetched).
All PDP-8 assemblers will generate current page mode when the addressed
location is in the current page.

<P>
Direct addressing of locations not on the current page is impossible,
but some PDP-8 assemblers will automatically generate indirect references
to off-page locations, storing the indirect word at the end of the current
page.  This usage is considered unsafe because indirection may change
the memory field being referenced!

<H3><A NAME=indirect>I - The Indirect Bit</A></H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	TAD I	ADDR
</PRE>
<P>
When the <A HREF="mri.html#format"> I bit </A> of the instruction is zero,
direct addressing is used.  This allows any word in either page zero or
the current page to be referenced as an operand.

<P>
When the <A HREF="mri.html#format"> I bit </A> of the instruction is one,
indirect addressing is used.  In this mode, the word at the addressed
location in page zero or the current page is used as a pointer to the
intended operand.  This requires one additional memory cycle for the
instruction.

<P>
All PDP-8 assemblers require the use of the I qualifier to indicate
indirect mode.  Some PDP-8 assemblers will automatically generate
indirect references for those instructions that directly reference
off-page locations.

<P>
Indirect addressing using locations 0010 through 0017 (octal) has the
side effect of incrementing these locations prior to use.  This is
called <A HREF="mri.html#autoindex"> autoindexed addressing </A>.

<P>
Indirect addressing may be used to reference operands in any memory field,
depending on how the DF (data_field) register is set.  By default, this is
usually the current field, the same field as that from which the instruction
was fetched.

<H3><A NAME=autoindex>Autoindex Addressing</A></H3>

<P>
If indirect addressing is done through locations 0010 and 0017 (octal) of
any memory field, the indirect word will be incremented prior to use.
Other than this increment, auto-indexed mode is the same as indirect mode.
Autoindex addressing is particularly useful for <A HREF="mri.html#block"> operations
on blocks of consecutive words</A>.

<H3><A NAME=immediate>Immediate Addressing</A></H3>

<P>
The PDP-8 does not support any immediate addressing mode, however, there
are <A HREF="mri.html#load"> microcoded instructions </A> that can be used to load a
number of useful constants in the accumulator in a single machine cycle,
and most PDP-8 assemblers support a notation for immediate constants.

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	TAD	(7)	/ add the constant 7
	JMS I	[PROC]	/ call PROC
	TAD I	(LOC)	/ add the contents of LOC
</PRE>

<P>
If an operand is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets, most PDP-8
assemblers will treat the operand as a value intended to be used as an
immediate constant.  To do this, the indicated value is stored in a memory
location, and the instruction is then assembled with the address of that
location as an operand.

<P>
If parentheses are used, the operand is stored at the end of the current
page, while if square brackets are used, the operand is stored at the end
of page zero.  All common PDP-8 assemblers will attempt to optimize constant
storage, checking to see if a constant in question has already been stored
at the end of the page in question and re-using that constant if so.

<P>
The usage <code>JMS I [PROC]</code> is a standard way to call an
off-page procedure.  This allocates a pointer to <code>PROC</code> at the
end of page zero; this pointer will be used by all other references to
<code>PROC</code> that are coded the same way.

<P>
The usage <code>TAD I (LOC)</code> is a standard way to reference a variable
<code>LOC</code> that is on a different page and that is local in the sense
that it only concerns a small number of routine.  In this case, a pointer to
<code>LOC</code> will be allocated at the end of the current page and shared
only by other references to <code>LOC</code> made from the same page.

<H2><A NAME=macros>Macros</A></H2>

<P>
The PDP-8 instruction set is so small that many operations that are usually
single instructions on a larger machine must be performed by instruction
sequences on the PDP-8.  While these are referred to as macros here, the
memory resources of the PDP-8 are limited enough that these are usually
not coded as given, but rather, carefully folded into other computations.

<H3><A NAME="load">Loading the Accumulator</A></H3>

There is no load accumulator instruction on the PDP-8.  As a result,
if the contents of location <code>M</code> are to be loaded into the
accumulator, the following instruction sequence should be used:

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	CLA
	TAD	M
</PRE>

In the event that the accumulator is already known to be zero, for
example, because the previous instruction was a <code>DCA</code>
operation, the above can be abbreviated to a simple <code>TAD</code>
instruction.  Other sequences are also effective, for example, it is
possible to and <code>M</code> with -1 to get the same effect.

<P>
In general, the PDP-8 does not support immediate operands, but
there are single-cycle microcoded instructions sequences that
load commonly used constants in memory.  These are conventionally
defined using the notation <code>NLXXXX</code> in PAL, where
<code>XXXX</code> is the octal constant to be loaded.  These are
usually defined, as needed, at the start of each PAL program:

<PRE WIDTH="60">
NL0000=	CLA		/    0
NL0001= CLA IAC		/    1
NL0002= CLA CLL CML RTL /    2
NL2000= CLA CLL CML RTR / 1024
NL3777= CLA CMA CLL RAR / 2047
NL4000= CLA CLL CML RAR / 2048

NL7777= CLA CMA		/   -1 or 4095
NL7776= CLA CMA CLL RAL /   -2 or 4094
NL7775= CLA CMA CLL RTL /   -3 or 4093
</PRE>

Given these definitions, the instruction <code>NL0001</code>, for
example, will load 1 in the accumulator.  Note that the instruction
<code>NL0000</code> is rarely defined or used (it means no more or
less than CLA), and note that these instructions have ill defined
effects on the LINK bit.  Some set it, some reset it, and others
leave it as it was.

<H3><A NAME="logic">Other Logical Operations</A></H3>

The only built in logic operations on the PDP-8 are the not and bitwise and
operations.  All others must be accomplished using instruction sequences.

<H4>Or</H4>

The most obvious way to or the accumulator with a value <code>M</code> from
memory is to use De Morgan's law, along with <code>TMP</code>, a temporary
location.

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	CMA		/ complement accumulator
	DCA	TMP	/   TMP = not(AC)
	TAD	M	/ get value to or with accumulator
	CMA		/ complement it
	AND	TMP	/   AC = not(M) and not(TMP)
	CMA		/ complement result
</PRE>
<P>
A clever alternative is to clear all bits from one operand that are set in the
other before adding the operands.  If both operands are initially in memory,
this alternative is faster and no temporary location is needed.

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	DCA	TMP	/ copy the operand
	TAD	M
	AND	TMP	/ AC = bits set in both TMP and M
	CMA
	AND	TMP	/ AC = TMP - (bits set in both)
	TAD	M	/ AC = TMP or M
</PRE>

<H4>Exclusive Or</H4>

The xor operation is sufficiently complex that a subroutine is usually
called for.  This operation can be performed using the following
identity from boolean algebra:
<PRE WIDTH="60">
a xor b = (a and not b) or (b and not a)
</PRE>
But leads to inefficient code.  A better solution rests on the fact that
binary addition is based on exclusive or, if only the carry bit can be
defeated, as follows:
<PRE WIDTH="60">
a xor b = (a + b) - 2*(a and b)
</PRE>
The second term computes the bits that will cause carrys; these carry
bits are then subtracted from the sum.  In PDP-8 assembly language, this
can be done as follows, using <code>TMP</code>, a temporary location.

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	DCA	TMP
	TAD	TMP
	AND	M
	CMA IAC
	CLL RAL
	TAD 	TMP
	TAD	M
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="arithmetic">Other Arithmetic Operations</A></H3>

<H4>Subtract</H4>

To subtract a value <code>M</code> from the accumulator, the value must
be two's complemented and then added to the accumulator.  This requires
<code>TMP</code>, a temporary location.

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	DCA	TMP	/ set aside accumulator
	TAD	M	/ get value to subtract from it
	CMA IAC		/ 2's complement it
	TAD	TMP	/ add back saved value
</PRE>

It is significantly faster to do reverse subtraction, subtracting the
accumulator from <code>M</code>, the contents of a memory location,
leaving the result in the accumulator.

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	CMA IAC		/ 2's complement accumulator
	TAD	M	/ add operand from memory
</PRE>

<H4>Bitcount</H4>

The following algorithm iteratively counts the number
of one bits in a word W and returns the result in the accumulator:

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	CLA
	DCA	TMP
	TAD	W
LOOP,	CLL RAR
	SZL
	ISZ	TMP
	SZA
	JMP	LOOP
	TAD	TMP
</PRE>

The above bit of code will, in the worst case, require as many as 12
iterations of the loop body, at a cost of 6 memory cycles per iteration.
Loop unrolling can reduce this, as illustrated below:
<PRE>
	CLA
	DCA	TMP
	TAD	W
LOOP,	CLL RAR		/ test bit
	SZL
	ISZ	TMP
	CLL RAR		/ test bit
	SZL
	ISZ	TMP
	CLL RAR		/ test bit
	SZL
	ISZ	TMP
	SZA		/ end loop if no more bits
	JMP	LOOP	/  otherwise iterate
	TAD	TMP
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="block">Block Memory Operations</A></H3>

In the instruction sequences for block operations, the bulk of the code
is usually concerned with setting up the auto-increment locations used
to index through the block or blocks being manipulated, and to setup the
count of words per block.  In all of the following instruction sequences,
the labels <code>X1</code> and <code>X2</code> are assumed to reference
autoincrement locations, and <code>TMP</code> is any directly addressable
temporary, used as a loop counter.  The comments are essentially
transliterations to C.

<H4>Block Zero</H4>
The following instruction sequence zeros a block of memory, starting from
<code>LOC</code> and occupying <code>CNT</code> words.

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	CLA
	TAD	LOC-1
	DCA	X1	/ X1 = LOC-1
	TAD	-CNT
	DCA	TMP	/ TMP = -CNT

LOOP,			/ do {
	DCA I	X1	/   M[++X1] = 0
	ISZ	TMP	/   TMP++
	JMP	LOOP	/ } while (TMP!=0)
</PRE>

<H4>Block Copy</H4>
The following instruction sequence copies a block of memory from the
block starting at <code>SRC</code> to the block starting at
<code>DST</code>; <code>CNT</code> words are
copied.

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	CLA
	TAD	SRC-1
	DCA	X1	/ X1 = SRC-1
	TAD	DST-1
	DCA	X2	/ X2 = DST-1
	TAD	-CNT
	DCA	TMP	/ setup TMP = -CNT

LOOP,			/ do {
	TAD I	X1
	DCA I	X2	/   M[++X2] = M[++X1]
	ISZ	TMP	/   TMP++
	JMP	LOOP	/ } while (TMP!=0)
</PRE>
