This document describes the RX01 (M8357) omnibus floppy disk interface
for the PDP-8/E, /F, /M, and /A computers.  The RX02 and VT78 diskette
interfaces are largely upwards compatable from this, as is the DSD-210
third-party RX01 compatable drive.
<P>
The RX02 supported double-density diskettes, and the RX03 added support
for double-sided diskettes.

The RX01 interface consists of two coupled components, the interface itself
and the microprogrammed disk controller.  Here, we will not distinguish between
these.  The computer interacts with this device through 8 IOT
instructions; these instructions, in turn, reference the registers described
below.
<P>
Note:  Most of these registers are accessed via the accumulator; such registers
are illustrated as their contents appears when loaded in the accumulator.

<H3>Command Register</H3>

The command register holds the current diskette interface function, and
the operation of loading the command register initiates these functions.
The command register has the following fields:
<UL>
<LI><TT>H --</TT> Head Select (not RX01).
    <BR>For the RX02 and RX03, this selects the head to use.  On an RX02, it
	must be zero (because only one head but the selection function is
	implemented).  On an RX03, it is used to determine
	which side of the disk is to be used.
<LI><TT>D --</TT> Density (not RX01).
    <BR>For the RX02, this selects the recording density to be used.
<LI><TT>M --</TT> Maintenance.
    <BR>If this bit is set, the interface operates in maintenance mode.
<LI><TT>E --</TT> Eight bit mode.
    <BR>If this bit is set, the interface loads and stores sectors as streams
	of 8 bit bytes.  If reset, sectors are loaded and stored as streams
	of 12 bit words.
<LI><TT>U --</TT> Unit select.
    <BR>The RX01 through RX03 dual diskette drives use only the low order
	bit of the unit select field.  The DSD210 allows up to 4 drives and
	uses the full unit select field.
<LI><TT>F --</TT> Function select.

</PRE>
The interface register is used for transfers of data between the accumulator
and the RX01 controller.  As such, it is used in filling and emptying the
controller's buffer, for transferring track and sector addresses to the
controller and for transferring error reports from the controller.

<H3>Track Address Register</H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">
            00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11

           |  Ignored  |     Track Address     |
</PRE>
Valid track addresses range from 0 to 76 (decimal), but standard software
never uses track 0 of a disk.

<H3>Sector Address Register</H3>

           |   Ignored    |   Sector Address   |
</PRE>
Valid sector addresses range from 1 to 26 (decimal), but note!  The sector
address for each sector is recorded on the diskette when that diskette is
formatted.  Nonstandard formatting software could, in theory, assign other
sector numbers!  The RX01 interface cannot be used to format a diskette, but
the DSD-210 supports formatting.

<H3>Error Status Register</H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">

                                    RX2   DS
</PRE>
The Error Status Register contains a large number of one-bit flags; for some
of these, the meaning depends on which drive type is in use.
<UL>
<LI><TT>RDY --</TT> Device ready.
<LI><TT>DD  --</TT> Deleted data encountered on read.
<LI><TT>DEN --</TT> not RX01:  Density of sector just read or written.
<LI><TT>DER --</TT> not RXO1:  Density error in read.
<LI><TT>WP  --</TT> RX01 and DSD210 only:  Write protect or not-ready.
<LI><TT>RX2 --</TT> not RX01:  always 1, reports RX02 attached.
<LI><TT>ID  --</TT> initialization done.
<LI><TT>PAR --</TT> RX01 and DSD210 only:  Parity error detected.
<LI><TT>DS  --</TT> RX03 only:  Double sided media detected.
<LI><TT>CRC --</TT> A CRC Error was detected.
</UL>
Note that the parity error bit reports on internal errors and not on errors
encountered in the actual disk I/O operation, and that the same bit is used
on the RX03 to indicate the presence of double-sided media.  The write protect
bit is not supported by most RX01 drives, but the option was supported on some
and was standard on the DSD-210.  On both the modified RX01 and on the DSD-210,
this bit also indicates drive-not ready.  On the DSD-210, it reports both the
state of the write-protect switch and of the notch in the diskette.
Unfortunately, on the RX02, this bit was used to indicate that the drive was
an RX02, and a fair amount of software used this bit to sense the drive type,
making it incompatable with the DSD-210 and the few RX01s that supported
write protect sensing.
<P>
The correct way to distinguish, in software, between an RX01 and an RX02/03
is to do a read-status command with the double density bit set.  On an RX01,
the double-density bit will be ignored.  On an RX02 or RX03, the result will
be either a density error or a report that double-density media has been
detected, so the error status and 0060 (octal) will be nonzero.

<H3>Error Code Register</H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">
            00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11

           |           |      Error Code       |
</PRE>
The Error Code Register contains a numeric error code indicating the cause
of the most recently detected error.  Codes are given in octal.
<UL>
<LI><TT>0010 --</TT> Drive 0 failed to see home on initialize.
<LI><TT>0020 --</TT> Drive 1 failed to see home on initialize.
<LI><TT>0030 --</TT> Found home prematurely on init (RX01 only).
<LI><TT>0040 --</TT> Bad track address.

<LI><TT>0240 --</TT> Density error (not RX01).
<LI><TT>0250 --</TT> Wrong key for set media density (not RX01).
</UL>

<H3>The Buffer</H3>

The RX01 controller buffer holds one sector (128 bytes), either the most
recent buffer read from the diskette or the most recent buffer transferred
from the PDP-8 to the controller.  This buffer is sometimes referred to as
the silo.  On the RX02 and RX03, the buffer holds 256 bytes, with the
extra capacity used only in double-density mode.
<P>
In 12-bit mode, two consecutive 12-bit
words are packed into three consecutive 8-bit bytes most significant bit
first, so the first byte holds the top 8 bits of the first word, the high
end of the second byte holds the bottom 4 bits of the first word followed
by the top 4 bits of the second word, and the third byte holds the bottom
8 bits of the second word.  In 12 bit mode on an RX01 only the
first 96 bytes (64 words) of the buffer are used, and on ouptut, the final
8 bits written gets repeated to fill the buffer.

<H3>The Transfer Request Flag</H3>

The Transfer Request Flag bit is set when most recently requested transfer
to or from the interface register has been completed.

<H3>The Error Flag</H3>

The Error Flag bit is set when any error is detected.  The cause of the
error is reported in the Error Status Register and the Error Code Register.

<H3>The Done Flag</H3>

The Done Flag bit is set when the controller completes a command.

<H3>The Interrupt Enable Bit</H3>
<PRE WIDTH="60">
            00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11

                                             IE
</PRE>

The Interrupt Enable Bit allows the RX01 interface to request an interrupt
when the Done or Error Flag is set.  Note that, unlike essentially all other
PDP-8 peripherals, the interface will not request an interrupt to signal a
transfer request!  The working assumption is that transfer
requests are sufficiently high speed that an interrupt on transfer request
would be inappropriate.  Indeed, in an interrupt driven system, the transfer
of blocks of data between the controller and CPU can be accelerated by writing
the transfer loops without any termination test, relying on the done interrupt
to terminate the loop.

The RX01 interface is almost always connected as device 75, however,
the (M8357) interface allows for any address from 70 to 77.  If a second
device is attached, it should usually be connected as device 76.  On the
VT78 and later interfaces, the SEL command is used for drive selection and
the interface is always through device 75.

<H2>Instructions (device x)</H2>

<H3><A NAME=sel>6750 - SEL</A> Select device pair</H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	SEL
</PRE>
For the VT78 and later interfaces for the RX01/RX02, this command loads
the least significant bit of AC into the drive pair select register.
These machines supported two drive pairs.  On the earlier RX01/RX02
interfaces, the drive pair was selected by using a different device
address for each pair of disk drives.

<H3><A NAME=lcd>67x1 - LCD</A> Load Command register</H3>

<PRE WIDTH="60">
	LCD
</PRE>
The command register is loaded from the accumulator and the accumulator is
cleared.  Note that on an RX02 or RX03, the command has 10 defined bits
and that only the low 8 bits are loaded if the interface is in 8-bit mode.
As a result, on an RX02 or RX03, when 8 bit mode is selected, the high bits
of the command register must be loaded with an extra STR-XDR sequence
immediately following the LCD.  The XDR sends the high bits of the
command register from the least significant bits of the accumulator.
<P>
Once the command register is loaded, the controller starts executing the
indicated command.  The interpretation of following instructions depends on
the command loaded, as follows:
<DL>
<DT><TT>0 --</TT> Fill Buffer.
<DD> The following sequence of 128 (in 8-bit mode) or 64 (in 12-bit mode)
     XDR instructions transfer data from the accumulator via the interface
     register to the buffer, until the buffer is filled, at which point the
     done flag will be set.
<DT><TT>1 --</TT> Empty Buffer.
<DD> The following sequence of 128 (in 8-bit mode) or 64 (in 12-bit mode)
     XDR instructions transfer data from the buffer via the interface
     register to the accumulator, until the buffer has been emptied, at
     which point the done flag will be set.
<DT><TT>2 --</TT> Write Sector.
<DT><TT>3 --</TT> Read Sector.
<DD> The first XDR following either of these instructions will transfer the
     sector address from the accumulator via the interface register.  The
     second XDR will transfer the track address from the accumulator via the
     interface register and initiate a seek for the indicated track and
     sector.  After the seek, the indicated transfer between the buffer and
     the diskette will take place, and then the done flag will be set to
     signal completion of the transfer.
<BR> (On the DSD-210, if the sector address given is 154 (octal), this is
     a format command, and it should be followed by a sequence of 26
     additional XDR instructions giving the 26 sector numbers to be written
     to the specified track, in whatever interleaved order is desired.)
<DT><TT>4 --</TT> Set Media Density (RX02 only).
<DD> The following XDR instruction transfers the key (0111 octal), verifying
     that this is indeed a set media density command and not an RX01
     no-op.  The desired density is taken from the command register.
<DT><TT>5 --</TT> Read Status.
<DD> The controller will check to see that a disk is in the drive and spinning
     properly, and then set the done flag.  The drive test is done by reading
     the header on sector one of the current track,
     so this command may take as much as one full disk revolution.
<DT><TT>6 --</TT> Write Deleted Data Sector.
<DD> Same as Write Sector, except that the sector is marked as deleted.
     After reading such a sector, the deleted data bit will be set in the
     error status register.  No known PDP-8 software other than diagnostics
     uses this feature, which rests on one bit per sector allocated in the
     standard IBM 8-inch diskette format to mark sectors as having been
     deleted.
<DT><TT>7 --</TT> Read Error Register.
<DD> This instruction moves the error register into the interface register
     and then sets the done flag.  This is the recommended way to set the
     done flag if no device operaton is required.

    and to the two XDRs used to load the track and sector registers after a
    Read Sector, Write Sector or Write Deleted Data Sector command.
<DT>Ors the interface register with the accumulator:
<DD>This applies to all XDRs after an Empty Buffer command in 8-bit mode,

This instruction must precede every XDR between the issuing of a command
and the setting of the done flag!  Data transfers between
the interface register and the controller are done over a high-speed serial
link, and take 18 to 23 microseconds, depending on whether 8 or 12 bits are
being transferred.

Typical PDP-8 assembly language programs begin by defining the necessary
IOT instructions.  In the case of the RX01 interface, these instructions
are rarely predefined and must be defined as follows:
<PRE>
	LCD=    6751	/ Load Command register
	XDR=    6752	/ transfer Data Register
	STR=    6753	/ Skip if Transfer Requested
	SER=    6754	/ Skip if Error
	SDN=    6755	/ Skip if Done
	INTR=   6756	/ Interrupt enable
	INIT=   6757	/ Initialize
</PRE>
In addition, it is common to give symbolic definitons that simplify formulation
of command words:
<PRE>
        MAINT=  0200    / the maintenance bit
        BITS8=  0100    / select 8 bit mode
        BITS12= 0000    / select 12 bit mode
        DRIVE0= 0000    / select drive 0
        DRIVE1= 0020    / select drive 1
        FNFILL= 0000    / fill buffer from cpu
        FNEMPT= 0002    / empty buffer to cpu
        FNWRIT= 0004    / write buffer to disk
        FNREAD= 0006    / read buffer from disk
        FNRDST= 0012    / read status to cpu
        FNWRDE= 0014    / write deleted buffer to disk
        FNRDER= 0016    / read error register to cpu
</PRE>

Given these, the following routine will initialize an RX01 drive and test
for media present; a more sophisticated initialization routine would return
a more useful error report.
<PRE>
	RXINIT, .-.
	/               Initialize a drive
	/               expects DRIVE0 or DRIVE1 in AC
	/               returns error status word in AC
	/               on return, skips if no error and ready.
		TAD     (FNRDST)        / make read stat command
		LCD                     /   and issue it
		SDN                     / wait for completion

The following service routines fill and empty the RX8E internal buffer in
12-bit mode.  As with the above code, these only make minimal provisions for
errors!  These two routines are not usually directly called by user code
(other than diagnostics), but are used as part of higher level read and
write routines.
<PRE>
	RXFILL, .-.
	/               given buffer address in AC
	/		transfer buffer to RX8E internal buffer
	/               wipes out X0

	/               returns AC = 0
		CMA IAC
		CMA			/ decrement buffer address
		DCA     X0              / setup to index through buffer
		TAD     (BITS12+FNFILL+DRIVE0)
		LCD                     / (note: this clears ac)
	RXFILP, STR                     / skip if ready to transfer
		SKP
		JMP     RXFIDO          / go fill buffer if ready
		SDN                     / if not, see if done

	RXEMPT, .-.
	/               given buffer address in AC
	/               transfer RX8E internal buffer to buffer

</PRE>
The above code makes no attempt to diagnose errors - it should use an XDR
after the SDN command detects completion, and then taken appropriate actions
based on the error codes reported.
<P>
The following routine for transferring the contents of the buffer to or
from disk is also fairly low-level.  As with the above code, it has
poor error reporting and would normally be called only from higher level
disk read and write routines.
<PRE>
	RXIO,	.-.
	/		read/write internal to or from disk
	/               expects DRIVE0 or DRIVE1 in AC
	/		other parameters are inline:
	/		1 - FNREAD, FNWRIT or FNWRDE
	/		2 - pointer to sector number
	/		3 - pointer to track number
	/		on error, returns AC = error status
	/		if no error, skip; AC = 0
		TAD I	RXIO		/ make command
		ISZ	RXIO		/   and advance to next
		LCD			/ issue command
		TAD I	RXIO		/ get pointer to sector
		ISZ	RXIO		/   and advance to next
		DCA	TEMP
		TAD I	TEMP		/ follow pointer
		STR			/ and then poll to wait
		JMP	.-1		/   for command to take
		XDR			/ output sector
		CLA
		TAD I   RXIO            / get pointer to track
		ISZ     RXIO            /   and advance to next
		DCA     TEMP
		TAD I   TEMP            / follow pointer
		STR			/ and then poll to wait
		JMP	.-1		/   for sector transfer
		XDR                     / output track
		CLA
		SDN			/ poll to wait
		JMP	.-1		/   for I/O done
		SER			/ check for success
		JMP	RXINOE
		XDR			/ get error status
		JMP I	RXIO		/ return

	RXINOE,	ISZ	RXIO		/ skip if success
		JMP I	RXIO		/ return
</PRE>

This code reports errors but does not handle them!  While it is tempting
to issue an <TT>INIT</TT> command after errors, parity and CRC errors should
be dealt with by reissuing the offending command, giving up after some number
of retries.  If the error is due to write protected media or device not
ready, there is certainly no benefit in doing a reset.
<P>
When an RX01 application comes into execution, the state of the drive may
be unknown!  It may be ready to accept a new command, or busy performing
a time consuming operation such as the power-on self test.  Because the SDN
command resets the done flag, the problem of synchronizing the application's
model of the device state with the actual state is not trivial.  The following
sequence of instructions will suffice to solve this problem:

<PRE>
		SDN
		NOP
		TAD	(FNRDER)
		LCD
</PRE>

This sequence first uses <TT>SDN</TT> to reset the done flag, if it was
set, and then uses the Read Error Register command to set the done flag.
Note that if a command is issued while another command is in progress, that
command is ignored.  Thus, in the event that a time consuming command was
in progress, the above sequence is a no-op and the done flag will come up of
its own accord when the previous operation completes.
<P>
Under OS/8 (prior to OS/78 and OS/278), the convention was established
that applications should exit either with an operation in progress or with
the done flag set.  The conventional way to set the done flag prior to
exit is to execute a Read Error Register command without checking or done
or using an <TT>XDR</TT> to actually read the error register.  Handlers
written for this environment can use simplified entry sequence, simply
waiting for any previous operation to terminate with SDN and then continuing
normally.
<P>
Another challenge is writing code to determine if the disk drive is an
RX01 or an RX02.  This can be done by issuing a Read Status command with
the double-density bit set (defined only for the RX02).  This bit will be
ignored on the RX01 and DSD-210, but on the RX02, the returned status register
will indicate that double-density has been selected.
